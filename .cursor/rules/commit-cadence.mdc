# Git Change Visibility + Conventional Commits (MUST FOLLOW)

- After each logical change or batch of edits, show a concise git summary: `git status -sb` plus `git diff --stat`, and list the changed files.
- If the diff is large or multi-file, show key hunks or ask whether to open the full diff.
- Split commits logically for review. Avoid bundling unrelated tasks; propose clean tranches when changes span multiple concerns.
- Propose a short, descriptive Conventional Commit message in `type(scope): summary` form. It should capture the logical change without detailed lists. If multiple tranches make sense, suggest a clean grouping and ask the user to pick.
- Before committing, run the checks and fix any failures:
  - Python: `ruff check .`, `ruff format .`, `ty check .` (via venv or `uv run`)
  - React: `bun run check .`, `bun run format .` 
- You may run `git commit` without asking for confirmation once pre-commit checks pass.
- If the user requests a commit mid-task, do it immediately after approval, then continue.
- At the end of the task, ask whether to `git push` and only run it with explicit user confirmation.
